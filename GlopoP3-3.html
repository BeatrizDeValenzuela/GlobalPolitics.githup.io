        </tr>
        <tr>
         	<td>Case Studies: The questions are based on pre-released case studies provided by the IB. These case studies are given to students ahead of the exam, typically several weeks in advance, allowing them to prepare thoroughly. The case studies cover a wide range of global political issues, such as conflict, human rights, development, environmental sustainability, and global governance.</td>

         	<td>Assessment Criteria: Answers are assessed on students' ability to apply relevant political concepts, theories, and case study knowledge to the questions. Critical analysis, argumentation, and the application of theory to real-world scenarios are emphasized. The responses should show depth of understanding, coherence, and the ability to engage with the complexities of global political issues.</td>
