         	<td>As a Global Politics Student, you will get to know why situations around the world have occured and you are able to analyse the possible viable solutions; deciding for yourself which you believe is the best and getting to know your interests better. This goes to say that although it may seem hauting to choose a subject with many requirements, Global Politics is truly enjoyable and makes you better understand the world you live in as well as learning about your political standing; developing both of these is one of the main goals of the course. By creating a safe space to express your opinions, the classess offer you both practicle and theoricle knowledge that can be applied not only in the real world, but in other subjects. For instance, in my French b SL class, we went over an Identity unit that dealt with the idea of immigration. Having previously learnt about the topic helped me have greater knowledge and made me able to concentrate on enriching my vocabulary on the topic instead of my knowledge. This is one of many examples that I could give to you about my experience, but if you ask anyone who takes or has taken the topic, i can almost guarantee that they have many of these stories to tell you. So, if you were to ask me what Global politics students get in return for taking the class, I would narrow it down to 3 things: 1. Enrichening your knowledge of the world; this helps you be able to talk to new people more easily as you can almost certainly find a subject related to Global politics that will interest you both. 2. Improves your Soft Skills; I won't go on about this as I have already mentioned it in the "Skills Developed" section. 3. It will almost certainly open up a door of interest in a topic; for me, this was the topic of the health crisis in North America in relation to (il)legal drugs.</td>
